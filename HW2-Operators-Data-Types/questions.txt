Question 1:
	a//b still equals np.floor(a/b), even when the sign is negative. 
	However, since np.floor(1.5) = 1 and np.floor(-1.5) = -2, a//b != np.abs(-a//b)

Question 2:
	a) [0, 2]
	b) [0, 34]
	c) [0, n - 1]

Question 3:
	a) a**b = pow(a, b)
	b) I knew this from a previous python class
	
Question 4:
	a) type(x) tells you the variable type of x
	b) because by adding the decimal point, you are casting the number as a float
	
Question 5:
	a) str(4) is casting 4 as a string
	b) int('a') is trying to cast 'a' as an integer, but errors because there is no way to convert 'a' to an integer
